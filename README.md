# PasswordSaver
Version: 1.0.1

Local encrypted database application designed for storing website usernames and passwords. Supports mulitple user login.

### Security Specs
* This application uses bcrypt to store hashed passwords for user login.
* Once logged in, information is encrypted with PBKDF2 before it enters the database.
* Encryption key is derived from your login password.
* Salts are generated randomly and stored along with your login username and password.
* Currently, there is no way to change your login password, as it is used to encrypt your data.
